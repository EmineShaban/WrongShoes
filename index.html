            How Poor Foot Hygiene & Wrong Shoes Resulted In Toenail Fungus

        <p>Hello, my name is Emma. I’m here to share my cautionary tale about dealing with toenail fungus. It’s never an
            easy subject to broach but I decided to help others avoid making my mistakes and suffering for it.
        </p>
        <p>My problems started with seemingly <b>innocent mistakes in foot hygiene and poor shoe choices. </b>It might
            sound trivial and silly, but by the end of my story, you’ll understand the importance of maintaining clean,
            dry feet and wearing comfortable, practical shoes.
        </p>
        <p>It all started with what I thought were minor inconveniences - a busy lifestyle, neglecting my feet’s hygiene
            and, occasionally, opting for fashionable yet impractical shoes that caused my feet to get hot and sweaty.
        </p>

        <h3 class="red">Little did I know that these seemingly harmless choices would lead to a struggle with toenail
            fungus.
        </h3>

        <p>As my days were turning busier, I <b>paid less attention to the well-being of my feet.</b> I would often
            neglect to -
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>dry them thoroughly</b> after a shower, </li>
            <li><b>avoid walking barefoot</b> in my gym’s locker room, or </li>
            <li><b>abstain from wearing closed shoes for extended periods</b> without allowing my feet to breathe.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I didn’t realize I was creating the ideal breeding ground for the stubborn, pesky fungi.
        </p>
        <p>The <b>first signs of trouble</b> appeared subtly -
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b> a slight discoloration</b></li>
            <li><b> a bit of itching</b></li>
            <li><b> a strange smell, </b> and</li>
            <li><b> a tiny discomfort. </b></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I brushed it all off, thinking it was just a passing issue and nothing to worry about.
        </p>
        <h3 class="red">However, as weeks went by, my toenail fungus escalated.
        </h3>
        <p>The once minor discomfort turned into <b>persistent pain</b>, the <b>discoloration spread</b> making my
            toenails awful to look at, and <b>my toenails had become extremely thick.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            I started noticing my poor shoe choices played a significant role in aggravating the situation. Those
            stylish but uncomfortable shoes that I loved so much were <b>trapping moisture</b>, providing the <b>perfect
                environment for the fungus to thrive.</b> It was a painful realization that fashion was taking a toll on
            my foot health.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Walking</b>, which used to be a simple and pain-free activity, was now a <b>daily struggle.</b> Wearing
            open-toed shoes was out of the question, leading to my confidence dropping rapidly. I decided it was time to
            address the issue before it became worse.
        </p>
        <p>After realizing my mistakes, I settled on a <b>two-way approach to deal with my toenail fungus problem -</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Various alternative treatments.</b> Over-the-counter creams and home remedies involving vinegar and baking
                soda, which ended up being quite painful, were slightly <span class="red-color">helpful but did not treat the root cause of the
                fungal infection.</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Podiatrist visit.</b> To my absolute horror, the specialist <span class="red-color">recommended invasive treatments</span> such as medical
                pedicures and laser treatment. I was terrified and yet, I didn’t waste time and made the costly
                appointments. After the painful procedures, the relief was temporary and short-lived. My toenail fungus
                was <span class="red-color">not cured.</span>
            </li>

        </ul>
